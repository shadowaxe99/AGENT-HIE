Shared Dependencies:

1. **Libraries and Frameworks**: TensorFlow or PyTorch, Docker, Neo4j/JanusGraph/Dgraph, Apache Jena Fuseki, Celery, Redis.

2. **Data Schemas**: The data schemas for the conversational datasets, response examples, and user transcripts would be shared across the training, evaluation, and iteration files.

3. **Model Architectures**: Transformer architectures like BERT, GPT-3 would be shared across the language_processing.py, training/model_architecture.py, and training/training_process.py files.

4. **Function Names**: Functions related to training process (next utterance prediction, maximum likelihood estimation, transfer learning, multi-objective training), evaluation (human evaluations, A/B testing, quantitative metrics), and iteration (error analysis, continual fine-tuning, architecture exploration) would be shared across multiple files.

5. **Agent Classes**: The core agent classes (Language, Knowledge, Perception, Reasoning) and task agent classes (Search, Creation, Automation, Analysis) would be shared across the agent and task agent files.

6. **Orchestration Logic**: The orchestration logic would be shared across the orchestration/orchestration.py, orchestration/async_tasks.py, and orchestration/microservices.py files.

7. **Deployment Techniques**: Optimization for latency, batching and caching, and model quantization techniques would be shared across the deployment files.

8. **APIs**: REST APIs for knowledge access would be shared across the knowledge_graph.py and possibly other files.

9. **Graph Query Languages**: Cypher or SPARQL would be shared across the knowledge_graph.py file and any other files interacting with the graph database.

10. **Message Names**: Message names for the Redis message brokering and queueing system would be shared across the orchestration/async_tasks.py and orchestration/microservices.py files.
